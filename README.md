The Social App.

This app began with the idea of matchmaking, and of countering the decision paralysis that has emerged from the extension of technology in social intractions, and in finding romantic, platonic, and business connection.

The logic is straight forward: an app that connects people, informally encouraging horizontal structures. 

Here are the use cases:
1. Organizers can register their events -- some sort of registry or repository
2. User can register their details, and we will assign them anonymous (hashed accounts)
2. Users or participants can post details for missed connection 
4. Users can post on a forum.
5. Organizers can post a query and users can vote

These use cases form the basis of this app. It is worth notuing that we are to use a peer to peer technology, but for the first version, we will depend on loosely connected, under verified data.
